						Why the World Is Shifting to Electric Vehicles
					</h2>
					<p> The shift to electric vehicles (EVs) isn't just about cleaner cars but safeguarding our future.</p>
					<p> As we can see, transportation has been a major and growing contributor to global CO₂ emissions.</p>
					<p> Technological advances are also making change more affordable.</p>
					<p><i>Transportation-related CO₂ emissions have surged globally over the past decades..</i></p>

					<p>
						The momentum behind electric vehicles is undeniable. Over the past decade, EV sales have skyrocketed, reshaping the global auto industry.
					</p>
					<p> A comparison of EV and gasoline car sales reveals a historic inflection point: EVs are no longer a niche but mainstream.</p>
					<p> While global trends are encouraging, adoption varies significantly by country.</p>

						Despite the surge in adoption, challenges remain. One of the biggest hurdles is infrastructure.
					</p>
					<p>
						While EV sales are growing rapidly, charging infrastructure often lags behind, creating "charging deserts" in many regions.
					</p>
					<p> Another pressing issue is the environmental impact of EV production, particularly the mining of key battery materials like lithium and cobalt.	</p>
