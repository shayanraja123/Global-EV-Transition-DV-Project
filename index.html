						The Global EV-olution: Are we there yet?
					</h2>
					<h3>
						For over a century, gasoline-powered vehicles have dominated our roads, fueling economic growth and personal mobility. But today, the very engines that propelled progress are accelerating a global crisis.

					<p><b>Climate change</b>, <b>urban air pollution</b>, <b>and energy security threats</b> have sparked a pressing need for transformation in the transportation sector.</p>
					<p> The shift to electric vehicles (EVs) isn't just about cleaner cars but safeguarding our future.</p>
					<h3>Press Play to view global CO₂ emissions.</h3>
					<p> As we can see, transportation has been a major and growing contributor to global CO₂ emissions.</p>
					<p> Technological advances are also making change more affordable.</p>
